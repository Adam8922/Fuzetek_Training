## Introduction

This space chronicles my evolution as a Python developer, starting from fundamental concepts progressing to more sophisticated techniques. Every work folder features working code accompanied by thorough commentary.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the category of the work:

- `Assignments/`: The assignments I finished using python.
- `Sessions Problems/`: The problems that we solved in the sessions.

Each folder contains:
- `README.md`: Summary of the work learning and challenges.
- Python scripts: Python code written.

## Challenges

Each folder includes a `README.md` file that outlines the challenge and provides a brief explanation of the solution.

## Helpful Suggestions

- **Environment Management**: Utilize virtual environments `venv` for dependency control.
- **Code Clarity**: Adhere to PEP 8 standards for maintainable code.
- **Consistent Practice**:  Regular coding sessions accelerate proficiency.
- **ELibrary Exploration**: Take advantage of Python's extensive package ecosystem.
